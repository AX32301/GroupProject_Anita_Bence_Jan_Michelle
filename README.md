## Code Description:
The programme can be found in 'Code' and must be executed on the user's own device. 
#### Part 1 - Requesting and checking input data:


#### Part 2 - Monte Carlo Simulation of stock price paths:


The sock prices are modelled according to the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM): 

#### Part 3 - Saving the simulation chart locally:


#### Part 4 - Saving the simulated stock prices locally in an Excel file:
