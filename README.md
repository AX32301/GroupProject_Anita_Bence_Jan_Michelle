## Code Description:
This program simulates future stock prices for a user-defined ticker.<br/>
A chart of the simulated paths & an Excel file containing the data will be saved on the user's device.<br/>
The programme can be found in 'Code' and must be executed on the user's own device. <br/>
Before running the Code please make sure the following packages are installed: yfinance, pandas, datetime, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, math <br/>
#### Part 1 - Requesting and checking input data:
Gathering user inputs: 
The user has to specify the ticker, the starting date for the estimation of mean historical returns & volatility, the forecast horizon(T) and the number of simulations (simruns). <br/>
The user inputs get checked for correct format. In case of an error, the input request is repeated.<br/>
Apart from all other input variables, the ticker variable is checked by the yfinance formula. In case of an invalid ticker, an error will be displayed.<br/>
At the end of Part 1 some core variables are calculated. For example, historical data for the specified ticker is gathered from Yahoo Finance, or daily stock returns are calculated. <br/>
#### Part 2 - Monte Carlo Simulation of stock price paths:
In the simulation, the outer loop(x) initiates the different simulations and the inner loop(y) calculates the daily future values. <br/>
The sock prices are modelled according to the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM): 
<br/>
#### Part 3 - Saving the simulation chart locally:
The figure containing the stock price simulations is displayed and saved locally as a plot.<br/>
This is an example of such a figure: 
<br/>
#### Part 4 - Saving the simulated stock prices locally in an Excel file:
The expected value of the stock at day T as the mean of all simulated final values is calculated. <br/>
Furthermore, a dates-column is added to the output table. <br/>
Lastly, the output table is saved locally as an Excel file, such that the simualted stock prices can be used for further analyses. <br/>
