## Code Description:
The programme can be found under 'Code' and must be executed on the user's own device. 
###### Part 1 - Requesting and checking input data:


###### Part 2 - Monte Carlo Simulation of stock price paths:


###### Part 3 - Saving the simulation chart locally:


###### Part 4 - Saving the simulated stock prices locally in an Excel file:


###### Final Comment:
This code derives some underlying ideas from: Teo Bee Guan (2021) <br/>
